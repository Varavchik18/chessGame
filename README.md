This is a WPF application that allows to play in chess with friend on 1 PC

All rules of this amazing game are implemented: 
1. En passant move
2. Castling only in suitable conditions
3. Threefold repetition
4. Fifty-move role
5. Stalemate
6. Checkmate as well

Features that probably you won't notice:
1. The color of player what need to make a move is the same as a cursor
2. Press esc to pause or restart the game :)

   So for now it is completed game as from the context of a chess.
   Im planning to:
   1. add a timer and timeout losing condition
   2. add offline/online mode that allows to play with friend by local network or global network.
  
Hope you will enjoy this game as well!
